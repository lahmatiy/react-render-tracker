# React render tracker

React render tracker – a tool to discover performance issues related to unintended re-renders

> STATUS: MVP / proof of concept
>
> The project is at an early stage of development. Lots of things have yet to be added and polished (see [roadmap](https://github.com/lahmatiy/react-render-tracker/issues/6)). Feel free to create an issue if you found a bug or have an idea.

![Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/270491/132439005-2525b8a6-c9f4-4171-b37a-39b0f3ed666c.png)

Features:

- Cumulative state of component's tree including unmounted components (can be hidden by a toggle in the top right corner) and number of updates (re-renders)
- Two types of hierarchy in component's tree: owner-based (created by, better for render tracking, that's by default) and parent-based (composed by)
- Event log for a component or its subtree, grouped by a React's commit of batch of rendering work, with some details on changes in components like context, state and props
- Self and total (including subtree rendering) cumulative time or all component renders (hidden by default, use toggle in the right top corner to enable it)
- Overall stats on events and component instances in status bar
- More to come... (see [roadmap](https://github.com/lahmatiy/react-render-tracker/issues/6))

## How to use

### Option 1 – Using with browser's devtools

1. Add to your html file a script before a React app:

```html
<script src="path/to/react-render-tracker.js"></script>
```

> NOTE: A path for a bundle in the npm package is `dist/react-render-tracker.js`

You can use CDN services to include script with no installation:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/react-render-tracker"></script>
```

2. Install [Rempl extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rempl/hcikjlholajopgbgfmmlbmifdfbkijdj) for Chromium based browser. Restart your browser for making Rempl tab visible in DevTools. (other browsers might be added later)

3. Open your html page and browser's devtools, open Rempl tab. That's it.

### Option 2 – Using with a web-socket server

Since project is based on [Rempl](https://github.com/rempl/rempl), it's also possible to use other hosts, e.g. [rempl-cli](https://github.com/rempl/rempl-cli) to launch a server. In this case, it is possible to inspect a react application launched in any web view with web sockets support.

1. Run following commands:

```
> npm install -g rempl-cli
> rempl
```

This will launch a Rempl server on port `8177`. Use `--port` option to specify any other port. See more option with `rempl --help` command.

2. Add to your html file a script before a React app:

```html
<script src="path/to/react-render-tracker.js"></script>
```

3. Add `<meta>` tag with specified origin of the Rempl server:

```html
<meta name="rempl:server" content="localhost:8177" />
```

4. Open your html and url of Rempl server. You should see connected instance of React render tracker, click on it to see UI.

## How to start playground locally

```
npm install
npm start
```

Open a URL displayed in console (e.g. `Server listen on http://localhost:3000`).
